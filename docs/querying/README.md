# Querying

The querying process is how Altis finds and fetches data from your Elasticsearch indexes.


## Automatic CMS Integration

Altis [integrates with queries in the CMS by default](cms-integration.md), transparently sending search queries to Elasticsearch while leaving other queries unaffected.


## Autosuggest

Altis also provides [support for Ajax-based autosuggestions](autosuggest.md) which automatically integrate with search forms on your site.


## Custom Queries

For advanced usage, you can perform [custom queries against the Elasticsearch indexes](custom-queries.md).

**Note:** Altis cannot provide support for custom queries directly against Elasticsearch.
